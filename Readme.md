# Image Processing Library for MNIST Digit Recognition

This project implements an image processing library in C++ and CUDA aimed at recognizing hand-written digits from the MNIST dataset. It includes a series of subtasks from basic image processing functions to the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the LeNet-5 architecture, followed by optimization using CUDA streams.


# Subtasks Overview

## Subtask 1: Implementation of basic image processing functions in C++.
## Subtask 2: Parallelization of applicable functions using CUDA kernels.
## Subtask 3: Construction of the LeNet-5 CNN using the implemented functions and pre-trained weights.
## Subtask 4: Throughput optimization with CUDA streams.
